This is an React Native Contact App where I have implemented the following functionalities:-
1. You can create a new contact by clicking on add new contact which will take you to new screen and you can enter your data there
2. You can mark an contact as favourite by clicking on star icon and that contact will be visible to you inside favourite screen, you can remove that contact as well
3. you can search your contact as well using provided TextInput above contacts.
4. I have used Context API for state management 
Note :- For Now there is no validation added to any text-input in this project and the second thing the add profile pic is just need an link and it is used just to make UI good nothing ,since we are not using any backend so you can paste the link of the image inside that text-input.
